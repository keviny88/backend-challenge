Back-End Code Challenge

Installation Prerequisites
Python v3.6.4
Today I will be using Python, for its readibility, ease of use, and its position as the primary component of the company's backend. For the database, I will be using SQLite, as it is already included in Python and will allow anybody to run this with ease without having to host on a server.

Assummptions
This application will only take in two files.
The description makes it seem like we can assume that there will only be one table, with its schema described in the file, "schema.csv". I allowed my program, and many of the class methods, to also allow schemas with different names, to account for scaling in the future and the possibility of having several tables.
